        <p>When Maps Lie<br>
        -Maps can visualize a lot of data quickly and effectively to people.
Even though this is a plus, there are also many times where maps can lead you to believe something that isn’t true. 
Geography isn’t a very heavily practiced subject in school, which means theres a lot of assumption with maps. 
This article raises awareness that just because you see a map constructed doesn’t mean its correct. 
A good map can also be misleading with its title, a good map should raise questions instead of answering a question. 
Ex. A photo coloring a state blue or red doesn’t reflect the state as a whole, a lot of arguments can occur
Legends should be clear, if something is bad, why is it bad. Make clear.</p>

        -Beaches are far from sedimentary due to their constant motion, wnd and water wear away at rocks, coral, shells, and other matter.<br> Certain materials stretch through time such as quartz and feldspar all of which are capable to last well through erosion. <br> When plastics are released into the ocean they too join the process.<br>Native Hawai’ians used the beach to harvest logs that had drifted into Kamilo from the Pacific Northwest, where shipwrecked bodies often turned up there.<br> Stories that relate to decentralized storytelling.

    <li>Animacy and (Non Human) Systems Through Time</li>
    <p>Arts of Living on a Damaged Planet<br>
        -A numerous amount of modern human activities have contributed to creating a lot of "monsters." While in Russia there are still radioactive traces found in residents of former plutonium-manufacturing district, soil and water. After physicans test the patients for certain diagnostics they were denied treatment because there were unclear results. Instead physicans were looking for cancerous results, when they should have been linked to bacteria. We live on a human-damaged planet, we aren't concious about what we can do the better the health of our planet. It just keeps getting worse. </p>
    <p>Learning the Grammar of Animacy<br>
    -Robin Wall Kimmerer speaks about the language of objects. As a bioligist the word "Puhpowee" is surprising when you realize it's a technical word. When Robin found this was a word deeply rooted in the language of those who came before her, she realized that the importance of her knowing the language is what keeps a culture alive. A story of a man when he was younger being told to hide by his mother when Indian agents came looking for those who spoke a native langauge, still bears that language. After seeing how much would be lost along with the language, Robin gathered with a group in efforts to practice and learn the language. There starts to be an obvious difference in how animate and inanimate beings, which broadly changes how we view our world. This memoir goes on to say that by speaking and thinking in English, it gives us the ability to disrespect natures. Yet when children are younger they refer to plants and animals as if they were people, until they are thought otherwise. If we have more of a concious by referring to nature as it instead of her or he.  </p>

Ed Roberts became part of a movement that urged everyone to be mindful of everyone aike. Having polio when he was younger damaged his respiratory muscles making an iron lung apart of his survival. He had to learn how to navigate life in a world built against him. When Roberts graduated from high school, and moved onto college his housing was a concern when attending U.C.

He would be wheeled to class, <b>have a classmate take his notes using a carbon paper.</b> The word spread about the assistance that disability students were getitng when attending U.C. Berkeley, and more disabled students found their way to the college. </p>
